# D3VirtualRobotProject
Virtual Robot Development

Our program is written in Python and requires pygame to run.

When the game starts it will randomly generate the locations of the different types of items, price and how many there are at that location. 

You will choose where the robot starts first

Then chose the type of items you want and it will display the cheapest list and highlight all the items on the map

You then will have to chose the amount of items you want to get and the time you have given the robot to find the objects

It will then find the objects and show you the ones it finds

You will then be able to see the final list of the cheapest items it has found
